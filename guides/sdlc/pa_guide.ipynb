      "[ *Process Assessment (pa_guide): A template for performing reproducible research within environments that are compatible with IPython Notebook. It is a sample guide within the [Data Analysis Workflow Navigation repository](https://github.com/vinomaster/dawn).* ]\n",

      "# Process Assessment Title\n",
      "[ *The intent of this system analysis workflow guide is to help streamline the activities associated with tuning (improving) a specific software system process. The objective is to produce an assessment report based on an investigation into a specific performance of a process along with reproducible code for future analysis. The approach of the analysis is to identify characteristics of a process bottleneck and to measure possible adjustments to the process that will remove the bottleneck.* ]\n",
