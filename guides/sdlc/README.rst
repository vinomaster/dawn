Motivation
============
This collection of guides was inspired by patterns identified in manual assessments of large complex software systems. The general idea is that a consistent analysis and reporting format can improve the time to value for software system enhancements. 

Purpose
=========
This collection of templates is intended to aid system assessment activities pertinent to the testing and evaluation phases of the software development process. 

Guides
=============

+ Case-based Reasoning Analysis
    :Description: The intent of this system analysis workflow guide is to help 
        streamline the activities associated with the evaluation of a functional
        aspect of a software system using a case-based reasoning process. The
        objective is to produce an assessment report based on an investigation
        into a specific functional aspect of a software system. The approach the
        analysis is to model performance on new problems using results from past
        experiences with similar problems.

+ Functional Analysis
    :Description: The intent of this system analysis workflow guide is to help
        streamline the activities associated with the evaluation of a functional
        aspect of a software system. The objective is to produce an assessment
        report based on an investigation into a specific functional aspect of a
        software system. The approach of the analysis is to model a problem and
        iterate through possible solution alternativs that will help achieve the
        functional goals of the system for the subject problem.

+ Guide: Process Assessment
    :Description: The intent of this system analysis workflow guide is to help
        streamline the activities associated with tuning (improving) a specific
        software system process. The objective is to produce an assessment               
        report based on an investigation into a specific performance of a
        process along with reproducible code for future analysis. The approach
        of the analysis is to identify characteristics of a process bottleneck    
        and to measure possible adjustments to the process that will remove the     
        bottleneck.

+ Regression Test
    :Description: The intent of this system analysis workflow guide is to
        provide a reusable utility for monitoring and regression testing a
        specific system process. The objective is to produce reproducible     
        process monitoring code and documentation of the regression analysis.
