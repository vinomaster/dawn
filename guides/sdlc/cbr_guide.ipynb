      "[ *Case-based Reasoning Analysis (cbr_guide): A template for performing reproducible research within environments that are compatible with IPython Notebook. It is a sample guide within the [Data Analysis Workflow Navigation repository](https://github.com/vinomaster/dawn).* ]\n",

      "# Case-based Reasoning Analysis Title\n",
      "[ *The intent of this system analysis workflow guide is to help streamline the activities associated with the evaluation of a functional aspect of a software system using a case-based reasoning process. The objective is to produce an assessment report based on an investigation into a specific functional aspect of a software system. The approach the analysis is to model performance on new problems using results from past experiences with similar problems.* ]\n",

Given the current state of the system,  what attributes of the problem are preventing an expecting result? events the system from solving the problem in its current the system would associate with this type of problem.*]\n",
