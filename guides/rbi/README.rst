Motivation
============
This guide was inspired by actual customer engagements around situation business problems. Regardless of the problem domain, most situations had the following common attributes:
* The problem was often short-lived.
* The problem had a significant negative business impact, justifying exploration and action.
* Time-to-value was imperative. Metric measured from problem identification to solution proposal to business decision to proposal execution.
* The investigation results needed to be quickly and easily synthesized into a proposal for action.
* A problem stakeholder must always be identified, otherwise execution of proposed action would be futile.

Purpose
=========
Situational problems demand a solution in a timely manner. Problem analysts can not afford to be impacted by incompatible tools for data aggregation, analytics, visualization and decision processing. A cohesive document comprised of business context, reproducible code, observations, visualizations and suggested actions is just good enough to support a timely solution proposal. This investigation   template provides an outline to help guide the iterative exploration into a situation problem.
