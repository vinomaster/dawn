      "[ *The intent of this data analysis workflow guide is to help streamline the activities associated with a situational investigation project.

The ultimate objective is the creation of a business proposal based on actionable insights.* ]\n",

Data is rarely in a raw form, it is always structured according to somebody\u2019s predispositions and values. Choices are made along the way that influence the data from construction to interpretation.
